# Abelian-sandpile-model-on-thermal-granular-pile
Numerical simulation based on the Abelian sandpile model. Iterations follows the basic rule of the sandpile model. Examples demonstrate various effects of
such model under different initial and boundary conditions. Attempts to simulate a thermal granular pile is included.
