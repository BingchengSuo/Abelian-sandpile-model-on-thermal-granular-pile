# Abelian-sandpile-model-on-thermal-granular-pile
Numerical simulation based on the Abelian sandpile model. Iterations follows the basic rule of the sandpile model. Examples demonstrate various effects of
such model under different initial and boundary conditions. Attempts to simulate a thermal granular pile is included. The heat diffusion folder aims to do some initial attempts to test diffusion equations. An overlay of the diffusion equation with sand pile model can be interesting

Examples of thermal/ non-thermal excited granular piles are presented
